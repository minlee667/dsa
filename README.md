Clean and well-structured implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms with explanations, complexity analysis, and problem-solving patterns.


## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my systematic practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms**, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and readable solutions.

Each topic includes:
- Clear problem breakdown
- Optimized solutions
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Common patterns used in interviews

The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving fundamentals required for **software, data, and machine learning roles**.

This repository reflects my approach to thinking through problems rather than just collecting solutions.
